# Project 9 - Final project

## Description 

In Module 3 we started with a new topic: machine learning. The first week focused on supervised learning models and using these to predict and classify given data correctly. The second week was focused on unsupervised machine learning and pipeline building.
The challenge for this final project is to imagine a business case according to a dataset that we chose. Then we have to chose the best way to do it whether we chose to use supervised or unsupervised learning.

I started by cleaning and preping the data to be ready for model fitting and application. Then performed exploratory data analysis, checked for outliers, and encoded. 


## Plan

- Create repo on GitHub
- Create a Kanban board on Trello for project management
- Data cleaning and preparation
- EDA and encoding
- Feature selection
- Hyper parameter tuning
- Application of models

## Deliverables

- Original data in csv format
- Cleaning code
- Clean data in csv format
- Slides for presentation
