# Project 9 - Final project

## Description 

In Module 3 we started with a new topic: machine learning. The first week focused on supervised learning models and using these to predict and classify given data correctly. The second week was focused on unsupervised machine learning and pipeline building.
The challenge for this final project is to imagine a business case according to a dataset that we chose. Then we have to find the best way to do it (supervised or unsupervised machine learning).

I started by cleaning and preping the data to be ready for model fitting and application. Then performed exploratory data analysis, checked for outliers, and encoded. 

After that I've decided to use Supervised/Unsupervised machine learning and selected X number of model to try.
I've created a pipeline for hyperparameters tuning and model selection.

## Business case

The growth of the esports market is significant and their demand for game and meta data analysis is growing accordingly.
Many factors have to be taken into account to perform in video games other than the athlete's abilities.

So I decided to work on a dataset related to video games. For this project I worked on the video game league of legend from Riot Games.
The business case is simple: try to predict the performance of a champion based on his statistics of the previous / current patch.

The dataset is available online on kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/league-of-legends-champion-stats?datasetId=1896889)
The data is composed of different csv files containing different indicators on the champions. Each csv file corresponds to a different patch.

Metadata:
Name : Name of the champion
Class : Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman, Support or Tank
Role : Top, Mid, ADC, Support or Jungle
Tier : God, S, A, B, C or D
Score : Overall score of the champion
Trend : Trend of the score
Win % : Win rate of the champion
Role % : Role rate played with the champion
Pick % : Pick rate of the champion
Ban % : Ban rate of the champion
KDA : (Kill+Death)/Assist ratio of the champion

## Plan

- Create repo on GitHub
